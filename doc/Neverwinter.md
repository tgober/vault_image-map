# Neverwinter

**Type:** Major City  
**Region:** Northern Sword Coast  
**Alias:** The Jewel of the North

## Overview

Known as the Jewel of the North, Neverwinter is a city rebuilding from devastation. Decades ago, the eruption of [[Mount Hotenow]] nearly destroyed it, leaving much of the city in ruins and thousands dead. 

## Current State

In the years since, Lord Protector [[Dagult Neverember]] has poured vast resources into reconstruction, restoring roads, repairing districts, and encouraging settlement throughout the region. Though progress has been steady, tensions run high. Many citizens resent Neverember's rule, seeing him as an outsider concerned more with his legacy than with the people. 

Still, Neverwinter has reestablished itself as a key port and cultural center along the [[Sword Coast]]. Its influence stretches far beyond its walls, and many who seek fortune or purpose in the North pass through its gates on their way to the frontier.
